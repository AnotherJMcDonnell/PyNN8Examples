This stands as a revision of the the class structure with increased arguments passed to __init__ 
and structures separated as distinct classes imported into the higher level : 


- Bundle 	<- Thalamic source\
		<- Column			<- Layer 4\
						<- Layer 2/3 \

It's by no means ready or fully debugged but should be a better utilisation of the class structure than previously shown.
