Problems to discuss
- Mention the bug that took ages to identify
- Problems with memory have now emerged
- Have worked on visualisation
- FEEDBACK 7/7/2018


To do
- Reduce size of weight list by doing convolution
- Change accuracy calculation
- Change selection to just selBest



- See if convergence with 250 gens
- Mave a visualiser tool that will look at pickled populations
- Sort out the weightings of the costs/fitnesses and constraints
- Move common functions into one .py and try ES
- Sort out a lock for the computationally intensive part to load balance
- Investigate memory usage (possibly use a sparse matrix class)
- Rename gene and individual

Things to think about:
- GA initialisation
- We want 100,000 evaluations

- Change model parameters to be more realistic.
- Do some research on and sort out cost function.
- Run model for a long time.
- How would this be run on SpiNNaker directly?

Done
- Get model to work!
- Make a child object of Network model that is simpler
- Visualsie the hidden layers 
- Sort out the output
